		<p class="text-muted">At Paws Center, our mission is to be a beacon of hope and compassion for animals in need, tirelessly working to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome them into loving forever homes. We are dedicated to providing a safe haven for animals who have been neglected, abused, or abandoned, offering them the care and support they deserve as they journey towards a brighter future.<br></br>
		Through our unwavering commitment to animal welfare, we strive to not only meet the immediate needs of the animals in our care but also to address the root causes of their suffering through education and advocacy. We believe that by empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources they need to be responsible pet owners, we can create a more compassionate community where every animal is valued and cherished.<br></br>
		At Paws Center, we envision a world where every animal is treated with kindness and compassion, and we are committed to making this vision a realityâ€”one paw at a time.
