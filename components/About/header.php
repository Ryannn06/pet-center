		<p class="text-muted">The Paws Pet Center was born from the dreams of two animal enthusiasts, Lola Enang and Lolo Martin. Inspired by their shared passion for animals and their desire to create a haven for pets in need, they opened the doors of Paws Center in 2005, a sanctuary dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in need.<br></br>
		The early days of Paws Center were characterized by an unwavering commitment to their mission, despite facing formidable obstacles along the way. With limited financial resources and a small team of dedicated volunteers, Lola Enang and Lolo Martin transformed a humble plot of land into a haven for animals in need. From makeshift kennels to makeshift office spaces, every corner of Paws Center bore the indelible imprint of their passion and perseverance.
